# NEON Sign Animation

Simple CSS animation implementation to recreate a glowing neon sign.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo for css stylesheet and an html test page for viewing.

### Installing

Drop stylesheet in your src and link via `head` in your view.

```
<link rel='stylesheet' href='neon-styles.css'>
```

## Running the tests

* Simply add the class `neon-contents` to the text you'd like to have neon applied to.
* Use the class `neon-icons` for a smaller text size for icons or captions.

### Break down into end to end tests

* To change the color of the sign, simple replace the text-border colors with your own!
* Recommendation to leave white `#fff` as the initial color for effect.
